Much once more and loses all. The Town Mousse and the Country Mousse. A country mouse invited a town mouse and intimate friend to pay him a visit and portake of his country fair.

            " by keeping the block-cateres far from the ports they sought to sail. They preyed on the British fleets by seeking dreadnoughts, battleships, and cruisers in nearly all of the belligerent seas. At the British Navy justified its costly power by keeping the German fleet practically imprisoned in its fortified harbors, the German submarines no less one-credit and glory by keeping even that overwhelming naval force restricted in its movements. Never unguard, ever in a certain sense, on the defensive. And meanwhile, these underwater craft so preyed upon British foodchips that in the days of the greatest submarine activity England was reduced to husbanding her stores of food with almost as great thrift and by precisely the same methods as the Germany suffering from the British blockade. Aircraft and submarines twin terrors of the world's greatest war, the development, though I know means the final development of dreams that many nations have dreamed.\n",

When Robinsons came in, his father arose from his chair and looked him long and earnestly in the face. Then he said, I am very sorry, Robinson, that you seem determined to continue your evil ways. If you do not do better, you will grow up to be a beggar or worse. Robinson cast his eyes down and said, I do not want to be a merchant.

It sounded like water running over rocks. He tried to get to the place from which the sound came. He tried to walk. When he fell, he crawled on his hands and knees. At last the sound was close by. He dragged himself up on the rocks. Yes, there was a spring of clear, cool sparkling water bubbling up and trickling over the stones. Robinson was so thirsty he put his face into the water and drank and drank. Then he sat down, and after a while he drank again and again. After Robinson had satisfied his thirst and rested a while, he felt...\n",
